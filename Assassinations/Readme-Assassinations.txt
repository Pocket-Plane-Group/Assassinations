Windows:

Make sure that you have obtained and installed the latest official Bioware
patch. Install the official patch BEFORE installing any unofficial
modifications.

To save you time and effort, it is recommended to backup dialog.tlk, chitin.key,
baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override directory before installing any mods.
This way, you can restore your "clean install" in seconds by deleting weidu.log,
dialog.tlk, chitin.key, baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override directory,
and restoring backups.

Make sure that Baldur's Gate II or ANY game-related utilities are not running.

To install the mod, unpack it into your game directory and run
Setup-Assassinations.exe.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-Assassinations.exe in your game 
directory.


Mac OS X:
---------

If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting
the new version.

To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder.
If properly extracted, you should have an Assassinations folder,
Setup-Assassinations, and Setup-Assassinations.command in your BG2 folder.

To install, simply double-click Setup-Assassinations.command
and follow the instructions on screen.

In case of difficulties:

1. Open the Terminal, type 'chmod +x' followed by a space, drag 
Setup-Assassinations.command into the window, press enter.
2. Type 'chmod 755' followed by a space, drag Setup-Assassinations
into the window, press enter.

3. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------

Q: Where to start?
A: Talk to Bernard in the Copper Coronet. He might have a message for you.
Q: But he doesn't!
A: If your character is a paladin, or your party's reputation is 17 and above,
the quest will not start. If you meet the requirements, make sure that you have
actually installed the mod. Open your game directory and run 
Setup-Assassinations.exe. If this file is not there, repeat the installation 
process as described above.

Q: Is Assassinations compatible with mod X?
A: Assassinations should work fine with other mods. Read each Readme file
for the additional information and the installation orders.

SPOILERS START HERE.

Q: I need some hints.
A: Here they are.

1) First, head to the Copper Coronet and receive a note from Bernard.
2) Meet Lynn in the Five Flagons Inn, on the second floor, in the last room.
3) If you betray Lynn to Inspector Brega, Renal, or, later in the game, to
Inspector Daton, the adventure will end.
4) If you refuse Lynn's offer, or decide to break the contract later in the
game, the adventure will end.
5) The player can refuse missions, but only once or twice. The first mission
is mandatory.
6) The player can display mercy, but only once. The fourth and the eighth
missions(Inspector Daton and Harpers) are exceptions from this case: if the
player displays mercy there, the adventure will end.
7) The player's companions may complain. However, only Mazzy and Keldorn
will actually leave the party or attack the player, and only during
missions one, three, four and ten(Lord Melyin, Amara, Inspector Daton,
the final mission), and only if they are close enough to the player. This 
means that they will not react, if they are inside a building/far enough from
the player.

Q: I need a list of missions.
A: Here it is.

1) Lord Melyin. Go to the Mithrest Inn at sunset(20,21,22 hours), and ask
the innkeep about Lord Melyin. Then go to the bottom left corner of the 
Promenade.
2) Nevier Costa. Go to the Temple of Lathander and ask the priests. Then head
to the slums, to the bottom right corner of the map.
3) Amara. Visit the slums to talk to her sister. Or visit the Promenade at
night - the bottom of the map, at the middle.
4) Inspector Daton. Visit the barracks in the Docks District. Then find
Daton in the Sea's Bounty. Finally, meet him near Cromwell's smithy.
5) Sir Alexis. Visit the Order and talk to the Prelate. Then head to the
prison in the Government District. You will find Sir Alexis there.
6) Oulav Steros. In the Bridge District, downstairs by the water. To get
the supplier's name, the player should perform three additional tasks:
   a) talk to Simon in the back rooms of the Copper Coronet;
   b) pass the message to Thumb in the Sea's bounty;
   c) pass the bribe to the guard at the Gate District. The guard has
      the necessary information.
7) Qyr. He can be found in the inn in Trademeet. After the first conversation,
head for the north of the map. Pass through the east city gates, head north,
and then west again(X=1563,Y=166).
8) Tea and Gannis, Harpers. Talk to Ribald Barterman. Then head to the Delosair
Inn in the Bridge District.
9) Kern, an assassin. Talk to Rose in the Bridge District. Head to 
the Government District and find Lady Sofia in the right bottom corner of the
map. Talk to her. Kern will appear after the conversation.
10) The final task happens in Chapter 6, after Bodhi is killed, or in Chapter 7.
Talk to Bernard in the Copper Coronet to get another message. Head to the Five
Flagons Inn in the Bridge District, the last room on the second floor, and meet
Lynn. Give her your word, or she will leave forever. Meet Lynn's employer.
Then meet Lynn in the Graveyard District, near the doors that lead upstairs
(the site of the funeral of Nalia's father). Make sure you kill everyone 
upstairs; when you do, try to exit the district. Watch the arrest and the 
quest's conclusion.

Q: What about a romance with Lynn?
A: There are ten banters, available during the entire course of missions 1-9.
The eighth banter(dinner) is a turning point: if you told her that you have
someone else, there used to be someone else whom you still love, or there is
an image of someone in your heart, the romance will end. If she says "You
fascinate me", you 'won' - the big payoff will come after the final mission.

If you are romancing Aerie, Jaheira or Viconia, there will be consequences.

-added folder libiconv-1.9.2-1-src.zip with iconv licence info

Version 15
-Receiving of last call to Lynn more stable: boy on the Graveyard will spawn directly beside the PC, if not talked to the PC can still talk to Bernard (moved the SetGlobal("O#CrLynnSpawn2","GLOBAL",1) from spawning script to boy's dialogue).

- Lord Melyin will be available from hour 18 through all night 
- if Pugney the barkeep is asked about Lord Melyin but it is not time yet, Pugney will tell the PC directly when the time has come (no need to initiate dialogue by the player) (This uses an invisible helper cre because WINNKEEP.cre cannot initiate dialogue).

- Daton should always go near the smithy if he says so (removed the EscapeAreaMove and put his spawn into area script instead)

- Prelate can be asked about Sir Alexis in chapter 6 after Bodhi is dead, too.
- Expanded time interval to ask Barkeep about Melyin (Time(18) to Time(23))
